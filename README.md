# Typetris

Tetris but make it a typing game.

## How to Play

Blocks fall from the top of the board. You want to line them up and fill in each
row. Each completed row will get cleared. However, before you can move each,
block, you must correctly type the word printed on it.

- Left and right arrow keys move the blocks.
- Enter and tab key drops the block: it will start falling quickly and focus will move on to the next block.
